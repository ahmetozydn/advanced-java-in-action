ORM Frameworks and Lazy Loading
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, such as Hibernate, often leverage Dynamic Proxy for lazy loading. Lazy loading allows the ORM to defer loading certain attributes or associations of an entity until they are explicitly requested. Dynamic Proxy plays a pivotal role in generating proxy instances that handle these deferred loads transparently.

Mockito, a popular Java mocking framework, employs Dynamic Proxy to create mock objects for testing.
