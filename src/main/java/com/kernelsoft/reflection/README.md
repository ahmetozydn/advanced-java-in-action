### __Used in__


- Reflection allows you to obtain information about a class at runtime, such as its name, superclass, implemented interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields. 
- You can use reflection to create instances of classes. 
- You can use reflection to invoke methods on objects dynamically, including public, private, protected, and package-private methods.
- Reflection provides methods for inspecting annotations as well as for accessing their values.
- Dynamic Proxy Creation: Reflection enables the creation of dynamic proxies for interfaces, allowing you to intercept method invocations and perform custom logic before or after method execution.
- Serialization and Deserialization: Reflection is commonly used in serialization frameworks to inspect and manipulate object structures dynamically during serialization and deserialization processes.
- Annotation Processing: Reflection facilitates annotation processing at runtime, enabling the discovery and interpretation of annotations on classes, methods, fields, and other program elements.


### __Usage__ 

- Dependency Injection Frameworks: Many dependency injection frameworks like Spring heavily rely on reflection to discover classes, inject dependencies, and invoke methods dynamically based on annotations and configuration.

- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): ORM frameworks such as Hibernate use reflection to map Java objects to database tables dynamically, as well as to perform database operations without explicit SQL queries.

- Serialization and Deserialization: Reflection is used in serialization frameworks (e.g., Jackson, Gson) to dynamically discover fields and methods of objects, and serialize/deserialize them into/from JSON or other formats.

- Testing Frameworks: Testing frameworks like JUnit utilize reflection to discover and invoke test methods dynamically, as well as to perform assertions and setup/teardown operations.

- GUI Builders: Some GUI builder tools (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA GUI Designer) use reflection to inspect classes and dynamically generate GUI components based on class properties and methods.

- Annotation Processors: Annotation processors leverage reflection to process and analyze annotations at compile-time or runtime, enabling code generation, validation, and other tasks.
